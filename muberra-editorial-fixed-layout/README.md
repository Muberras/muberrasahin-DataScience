# Muberra — Editorial (HTML5 UP)

This is a lightweight personal site using the **Editorial** theme by HTML5 UP.
It includes:
- Profile photo at `images/me.jpg`
- CV at `assets/Muberra_Resume_2025.pdf`
- Intro section with links

## Quick publish (GitHub Pages)

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (recommended name: `muberras.github.io` for a user site, or any repo for a project site).
2. Upload **all files in this folder** (keep the folder structure). Ensure `.nojekyll` is included.
3. In the repo: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: `Deploy from a branch`**, then select `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder. Save.
4. Wait a minute for deployment. Your site will be at:
   - `https://muberras.github.io/` (if using the special user‑site name), or
   - `https://muberras.github.io/REPO_NAME/` (for a project site).

To update the intro text or links, edit `index.html`.
